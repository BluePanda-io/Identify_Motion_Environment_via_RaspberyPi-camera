# Image Processing Masks-Convolution

The goal of this project is the creation of a device with image processing capabilities and real-time constraints. The final project contains a raspberry pi and a camera with dedicated function the identification of the motion in the environment and the start of recording with ultimate goal the actual stitching of video footage that contains only the important information. This project is vital for two main reasons. 1) The significant reduction in memory usage. 2) The actual efficiency for the user that needs to investigate the footage. - Originally developed 25/06/2017
